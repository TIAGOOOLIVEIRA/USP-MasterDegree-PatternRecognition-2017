## Machine Learning - Evaluations for Supervised ML Algorithms

This project was built by Tiago Oliveira and Marcelo Figueiredo ~August-November 2017~ [ti.olive@gmail.com](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoliveira/), [marcelo.fda@gmail.com].

It was developed essencially in R language with some exploratorial tests using Python (Tensorflow and Skikit-Learning) during the course "Pattern Recognition" in [University of Sao Paulo/Brazil](http://ppgsi.each.usp.br)

In the file "SIN5007 - Final.pdf" is possible to compare the performance and accuracy among different Machine Learning Algorithms.
